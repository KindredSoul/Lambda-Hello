Hello! My name is Jabril Breckenridge and I am currently a developer in training. I'm orderly, manipulative, and adventurous. I dislike animals , I'm a vegan, and I practice krav maga among other things. I will one day become a great leader, but for now I'll rule cyberspace as a software developer. You're welcome for the read.
