Hello! My name is Jabril Breckenridge and I am currently a developer in training. I'm animated, hardworking, and reserved. I like wolves, food, MTG, and a few other things. I hope to one day become a great engineer, but for now I'll settle for a deent software developer. Thanks for reading. See ya!
